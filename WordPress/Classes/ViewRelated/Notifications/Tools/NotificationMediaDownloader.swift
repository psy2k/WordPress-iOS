*  @class           NotificationMediaDownloader
*  @brief           The purpose of this class is to provide a simple API to download assets from the web.
*  @details         Assets are downloaded, and resized to fit a maximumWidth, specified in the initial download call.
*                   Internally, images get downloaded and resized: both copies of the image get cached.
*                   Since the user may rotate the device, we also provide a second helper (resizeMediaWithIncorrectSize),
*                   which will take care of resizing the original image, to fit the new orientation.
